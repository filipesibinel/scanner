# MTG Card Scanner

A camera-based scanner for Magic: The Gathering cards. Put a card under the camera, and the
scanner finds it in the video feed, identifies the exact printing with a vision AI, tells you
whether it's foil, and adds it to a local inventory you can export to CSV or Moxfield.

It also scans **Pokémon** cards (one game at a time - pick it in the top bar); see
[Pokémon](#pokémon) below.

It runs as a small web app (Flask + Socket.IO) on a Raspberry Pi or any Linux machine with a
USB webcam or Raspberry Pi camera, and is used from a browser on the same network.

## How it works

1. **Find the card** - each camera frame is searched for the card's outline: the largest
   four-sided shape with a card's 88×63 mm proportions. This takes a few milliseconds and
   isn't fooled by foil glare inside the card.
2. **Capture** - the card is cut out and perspective-corrected into a flat, upright image.
3. **Identify** - a vision AI reads the card name, collector number and set code from that image.
4. **Foil check** - modern cards print a star (`HOB★EN`) instead of a dot (`HOB•EN`) next to
   the set code on foil copies. The AI is shown a zoomed crop of that corner and asked which
   one it is.
5. **Match the printing** - set code + collector number (unique for every printing), checked
   against the name, are looked up in a local copy of
   [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)'s card data, which also provides prices, images and
   which finishes each printing exists in.
6. **Add to inventory** - auto scanning adds it automatically (or you confirm it) and the card is
   stored with quantity, condition and finish.

## Features

- **Live camera view** with the detected card outlined; the status turns from
  *Stabilizing* to *Ready* when the card is still.
- **Manual or automatic capture** - capture on demand, or start auto scanning and just drop
  cards into the box: each one is identified in the background and added to the inventory
  automatically, with a one-click Undo.
- **Vision AI providers** - Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or a self-hosted model
  via Ollama (or another OpenAI-compatible server). Switch provider and model from the UI.
- **Exact printing identification** from the set code and collector number, with name
  matching that tolerates misreads, accents ("Fili" → "Fíli"), flavor names ("Bucklebury
  Ferry") and shortened legendary names ("Thanos" → "Thanos, the Mad Titan").
- **Foil detection** from the ★/• marker, combined with printing data: printings that only
  exist in foil (or only non-foil) are known for certain. The card panel pre-selects the
  finish and shows why.
- **Manual search with treatment filter** - borderless, showcase, extended art, full art,
  retro frame, etched, surge foil. When several printings match, pick the one you have from
  a grid of thumbnails.
- **Inventory** with automatic duplicate merging, condition, regular / foil / surge foil,
  prices, filtering, sorting, editing, CSV import, and export to CSV or
  [Moxfield](https://moxfield.com).
- **Anti-glare** preprocessing option for reflective cards, sound effects, and a
  dark/light interface that follows your system theme.
- **Housekeeping** - scanned images older than 7 days are cleaned up automatically. The app
  checks for newer card data when it starts (and daily) and marks the Database counter with
  a dot; click it to update.

## Requirements

- **Computer**: Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, or any Linux machine (developed on x86-64 Linux)
- **Camera**: USB webcam (autofocus strongly recommended) or Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- **Python**: 3.10 or newer (tested with 3.12 and 3.14)
- **Disk**: ~300 MB for dependencies, ~75 MB for the card database
- **AI**: an API key for Gemini, OpenAI or Anthropic, **or** a local Ollama server with a
  vision model
- **Internet**: to download the card database, show card images, and reach cloud AI providers

## Installation

The deployment script installs everything and can set the scanner up as a service. Run it on
the machine that will run the scanner (a Raspberry Pi or any Linux PC):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipesibinel/scanner.git
cd scanner
./scripts/deploy.sh             # install: packages, venv, .env, camera check, card database
./scripts/deploy.sh --service   # optional: run as a service that starts on boot
```

Then add your AI key to `.env` (see below) and open `http://<device-ip>:5000`. Useful options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--camera N` | Use USB camera `/dev/videoN` (the script lists the cameras it finds) |
| `--picamera` | Raspberry Pi camera module |
| `--service` / `--remove-service` | Install / remove the systemd service |
| `--update` | Pull the latest code, update packages, restart the service |
| `--refresh-cards` | Re-download the card database (new cards and prices) |
| `--with-yolo` | Also install the optional YOLO fallback detector (~1 GB) |

The script is safe to run again at any time - it only does what is missing, and uses `sudo`
only to install missing system packages or the service. [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) has the
details: Raspberry Pi setup, remote deployment over SSH, updating and uninstalling.

### Manual installation

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
venv/bin/python setup_database.py     # download the card database (a few minutes)
cp .env.example .env                  # then add your API key(s)
```

Set `camera.usb_index` in `config.yaml` to your camera's `/dev/videoN` number
(`v4l2-ctl --list-devices`, package `v4l-utils`). For the Raspberry Pi camera module, install
`python3-picamera2` with apt and create the venv with `--system-site-packages`.

The optional YOLO fallback detector (`detection.method: auto` or `yolo`) needs
`requirements-yolo.txt`, which pulls in PyTorch; its model (`yolov8n.pt`) is downloaded into
`data/` on first use. With the default outline detection it is not
needed; if it's configured but not installed, the scanner logs a warning and uses outline
detection.

## Choosing a vision AI provider

Enter API keys in **Settings → Vision AI**: pick a provider and a key field appears (keys you
saved before are shown masked, e.g. `AIza…3f9Q`, never in full). They are stored in
`data/api_keys.env` (readable only by you) and used immediately. Keys can also be put in `.env`;
keys saved in the web interface take precedence.

| Provider | Setting | Key / endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` ([get a key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)) |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Local (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) | `local` | `vision_ai.local.endpoint` in `config.yaml`, or `LOCAL_AI_ENDPOINT` |

The default provider is set by `vision_ai.provider` in `config.yaml` (or `VISION_AI_PROVIDER`),
but you can switch provider and model at any time in **Settings → Vision AI**; the choice is
remembered in `data/settings.json`.

**Local models**: pick a vision-capable model in **Settings → Vision AI** - the list is loaded
from your server (or check with `curl http://<server>:11434/api/tags`). Thinking is switched off for Ollama
requests, so "thinking" models such as `qwen3.5` answer in about a second instead of
reasoning for tens of seconds. The model is preloaded when you start auto scanning and kept
loaded for 30 minutes, so the first card doesn't wait ~10 s for it to load.

`qwen3.5:9b` is the recommended model (about 1 s per card on a desktop GPU). It needs more
than 6 GB of GPU memory; on smaller GPUs `qwen3.5:4b` works, but it is slower on weak GPUs and
more often mistakes regular cards for foil - see PROGRAM_DOCUMENTATION.md for the comparison.

**Prompts**: **Settings → Vision AI → Edit prompts** shows what the AI is asked (card
identification and the foil marker check) and lets you change it - for all models or just the
one in use, since smaller local models sometimes need different wording. **Test on last
capture** runs the edited text on the last captured card before you save it, and shows the
answer and the printing it would match. **Restore default** goes back to the built-in prompt.
Only the instructions are editable; the answer format is added automatically. Edited prompts
are saved in `data/prompts.json`.

The foil check sends one extra small request per card. It is free with a local model; for
cloud providers you can turn it off with `vision_ai.detect_foil: false`.

## Running

If you installed the service, it's already running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mtg-scanner      # or: restart, stop
journalctl -u mtg-scanner -f           # live logs
```

Otherwise start it by hand:

```bash
venv/bin/python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` (or `http://<device-ip>:5000` from another device).
`scripts/start.sh` does the same but also loads `.env` and checks your API key and database
first.

## Using the scanner

### Scanning cards

1. Put a card in front of the camera. It gets an outline in the video and the status pill
   shows **Focusing** / **Stabilizing**, then **Ready** once the card is still and sharp.
2. Click **Capture card**, or **Start auto scanning** to capture every time a new card is
   ready.
3. The card panel shows the identified printing, its price and treatment. The finish
   (Regular / Foil / Surge foil) is pre-selected with the reason, e.g.
   *"Foil: ★ next to the set code"* or *"only printed in foil"*.
4. Adjust quantity or condition if needed and click **Add to inventory**, or **Skip**.

Auto scanning is made for dropping cards onto a pile in the box. Each card is captured once.
**Drop the next card when you hear the capture beep**: it sounds once the image is taken (every
few cards the scanner also checks the focus first, ~1 s, while the status shows *Capturing -
wait for the beep*); then the status shows **Captured - drop the next card**, and the next capture happens
when a new card has been dropped on top and has settled. The drop is recognized by the motion
(the card briefly vanishing or jumping, a hand) and by where the new card lands, so two
identical copies in a row are both captured.

**Sleeved cards:** turn on **Fixed area** in the camera panel. The first time, drag a rectangle
on the video around where the cards land (or click **Use detected card**); **Area** redraws it.
Cards are then judged by the image inside that area instead of their outline, which a pile of
sleeves confuses, and the photo sent to the AI is exactly that area - draw it around the whole
card. Turn it off again for cards without sleeves.

By default (**Settings → Add cards automatically**) cards are identified in the background and
added to the inventory without review, so you can keep dropping cards; the *Processing* counter
in the top bar shows how many are still being identified. After each add the card panel shows
what was added (name, set, finish) with an **Undo** button. Only cards whose exact printing is
confirmed (set code + number, or name + number) are added automatically. Anything less certain
(printing not confirmed, name not found, nothing readable) goes to the **Review** queue and
scanning goes on: the *Review* counter in the top bar shows how many are waiting. Click it when
you're done to go through them one by one - each shows the capture next to the suggested card
and what the AI read, with a search to correct it; **Add** adds the card shown (and opens the
next), **Skip** / **Delete** drop the capture, **Close** keeps the rest for later (the queue is
kept across restarts). A card whose name can't be read (runes, another language) is found by
its set code + number alone - leave the name empty.

Turn the switch off to confirm each card with **Add** / **Skip** instead; auto scanning then
waits for you before the next capture (a card dropped before you click Add is captured right
after). The setting is remembered.

### Searching manually

Type a name in **Search**, optionally with the **Set** code and **Number** from the card's
bottom-left corner (e.g. `HOB` and `14`) - together they go straight to the exact printing -
and a **Treatment** (e.g. Borderless). If more than one printing matches, choose yours from
the thumbnail grid. After a capture, the fields are filled with what the AI read, so you can
correct a misread and search again. Press Enter in any field to search.

### Pokémon

Choose **Pokémon** in the game selector in the top bar. The first time, its card data
(~21,000 cards from [TCGdex](https://tcgdex.dev)) is downloaded automatically in a few seconds.
Scanning works the same way: the AI reads the name, the number with the set total
(`012/193`) and, on Scarlet & Violet era cards, the set abbreviation (`PAL`). A card is added
automatically when set + number, or name + number + set total, identify exactly one printing;
otherwise it waits for review. In manual search, type the number as printed (`012/193`); with
the set total, or with the set code, the name can be left empty.

The card panel only offers the finishes the printing exists in (normal, holo, reverse holo,
1st edition). **Reverse holos are not recognized from the image** - the suggestion is the
normal print, so change it before adding. Prices are TCGplayer market prices per finish.
Pokémon support was tested on official card images; camera scans still need real-world tuning.

### Inventory

Open it from the inventory count in the top bar. Each entry shows a thumbnail of what was
captured: hover over an entry to see all its captured copies side by side, or click (tap) the
thumbnail to open them larger - handy to check what a scan actually added. You can filter, sort (newest / oldest, name,
price, total value, quantity, rarity, set and number - the choice is remembered in the browser),
edit quantity / condition / finish (changing the finish of part of a stack splits it; the price follows the finish), delete, clear, import a CSV, and
export to **CSV** or **Moxfield**. Adding a card that is already in the inventory with the same
condition and finish increases its quantity instead of creating a duplicate.

### Tips for reliable scans

- **Contrast**: a light, plain background (e.g. a white box) makes the card's dark border
  easy to find. White-bordered cards on a white background have no visible outline - use
  `detection.method: auto` (YOLO fallback) or capture them with auto-detection turned off.
- **Keep the whole card in view** with a small margin. If an edge is cut off, the card isn't
  detected - and the foil marker in the bottom-left corner can't be read.
- **Focus**: click **Refocus** once with a card in the box. The scanner sweeps through the
  camera's focus range (~10 s), locks the sharpest position and remembers it - no autofocus
  hunting when cards are dropped quickly. While you scan, every few cards it checks whether a
  slightly different focus is sharper and follows it (the best focus drifts as the pile grows
  and the camera warms up); if a card stays blurry for 3 s it refocuses completely. **Settings → Camera autofocus** switches back to the
  camera's continuous autofocus.
- **Camera sideways** gives more detail and a taller pile: the card's long side then runs along
  the image's long side. Set **Settings → Camera rotation** so the card shows upright.
- **Light** evenly from above; the **Anti-glare** option helps with reflective foils.
- Cards printed before the ★/• convention (roughly before 2020) have no foil marker; for
  those, set the finish yourself when both versions exist.

## Configuration

Settings live in `config.yaml`. The most useful ones:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `camera.type` | `auto` | `auto`, `usb` or `picamera` |
| `camera.usb_index` | | `/dev/videoN` number of the USB camera |
| `camera.resolution` / `fps` | `[2560, 1440]` / `20` | Capture resolution and frame rate |
| `detection.method` | `contour` | `contour` (outline only), `auto` (outline, then YOLO), `yolo` |
| `detection.allow_landscape` | `false` | Accept cards lying sideways (a card's art box can look like a sideways card) |
| `auto_capture.delay` | `1.0` | Minimum seconds between automatic captures |
| `auto_capture.stability_frames` | `5` | Still, in-focus frames required before capturing |
| `auto_capture.min_sharpness` | `250` | Minimum sharpness for auto-capture; lower it if cards stay on *Focusing* |
| `auto_capture.refocus_every` | `3` | Every this many captures, check if a focus one step away is sharper and follow it; `0` = off |
| `fast_scan.stability_frames` | `6` | Same, when adding cards automatically (~0.3 s, lets a dropped sleeved card stop sliding) |
| `anti_glare.enabled` | `false` | Default for the anti-glare toggle |
| `camera.rotate` | `0` | Rotate the image (0/90/180/270) for a camera mounted sideways - also in Settings |
| `vision_ai.provider` | `gemini` | Default AI provider (see above) |
| `vision_ai.detect_foil` | `true` | Read the ★/• foil marker |
| `vision_ai.image_size` | `1024` | Longest side of the card image sent for identification (larger = slower, not more accurate) |
| `vision_ai.local.endpoint` | | Local AI server (the model is chosen in Settings) |
| `flask.host` / `port` | `0.0.0.0` / `5000` | Web server address |
| `cleanup.enabled` / `days` | `true` / `7` | Delete scanned images older than N days on startup |

Environment variables `VISION_AI_PROVIDER` and `LOCAL_AI_ENDPOINT` override the matching
settings.

## Maintenance

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Update card data and prices | Click the Database counter when it shows a dot, **Settings → Update card database** (the game being scanned), or `python3 setup_database.py` (Magic) |
| Scanned image statistics | `python3 cleanup.py --stats` |
| Delete old scanned images | `python3 cleanup.py --days 30` (add `--dry-run` to preview, `--all` for everything) |
| Back up database, inventory, settings, images and `.env` | `scripts/backup.sh` (set `SCANNER_DIR` at the top first) |

Your inventory lives in the same SQLite file as the card data (`data/cards_database.db`,
table `inventory`); updating the card database does not touch it, and scanning keeps working
during an update (the new data replaces the old in one step at the end). How old Magic data may
get before the update notice shows is `database.update_after_days` in `config.yaml` (7).

Logs are written to `data/logs/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `app.log` | Web app, searches, inventory actions |
| `ai.log` | AI requests and responses |
| `scanner.log` | Camera, detection, captures |
| `database.log` | Database queries |
| `scanned_cards.log` | One CSV line per identified card |

## Troubleshooting

**No camera found / black video** - check the device number with `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`
and set `camera.usb_index`. Only one program can use the camera at a time.

**Auto scanning never captures** - the status tells you why: *Focusing* (image not sharp
enough - click **Refocus**, or lower `auto_capture.min_sharpness`), *Stabilizing* (card still
moving), or *Captured - drop the next card* (it's waiting for a new card to land). The log
shows *New card detected* with the measured jump and image change for each drop.

**Card not detected** - make sure the whole card is visible with some margin and the
background contrasts with the border (see *Tips*). For cards without a clear outline, set
`detection.method: auto` to fall back to YOLO.

**"Vision AI disabled"** - no API key was found for the selected provider. Check `.env`, or
switch provider in Settings.

**Local AI returns 404** - Ollama answers 404 when the requested model isn't installed. Pick
one of the models listed in Settings (they come from your server) or `ollama pull` it.

**Wrong printing** - check the set code and number the AI read (shown in the Search bar after
a capture); correct them there and search again, or pick the printing from the grid. If a model
keeps misreading the same thing, adjust its prompt in **Settings → Vision AI → Edit prompts**
and check it with **Test on last capture**.

**The YOLO extras fail to install** - PyTorch wheels can lag the newest Python. With
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, `deploy.sh --with-yolo` creates a Python 3.12
environment automatically; otherwise create one yourself (`uv venv --python 3.12 venv`).

**The service doesn't start** - `journalctl -u mtg-scanner -n 50` shows why (most often the
card database is missing or another program has the camera).
